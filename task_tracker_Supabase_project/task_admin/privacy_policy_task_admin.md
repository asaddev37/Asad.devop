Privacy Policy for Task Admin App
Last Updated: May 16, 2025
Introduction
Task Admin is a mobile and web application developed by AK’s Team to help administrators manage tasks and oversee student activities in the Task Tracker system. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring transparency in how we handle personal data. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, store, and share your information when you use the Task Admin app. It applies to the app, its related services, and interactions with us.
If you have questions about this policy, contact us at support@tasktracker.com.
Scope
This policy applies to the Task Admin app and its services. It does not cover third-party services (e.g., Supabase) that we may integrate with. We recommend reviewing their privacy policies for more information.
Data We Collect
We collect the following types of data to provide and improve our services:

Personal Information: When you sign up or use the app, we may collect your name, email address, role (e.g., "admin"), and user ID.
Student Data: Information about students you manage, such as names, student IDs, and task assignments.
Task Data: Information about tasks you create or oversee, including titles, descriptions, due dates, and status.
Device Information: Data such as your device type, operating system, IP address, and browser type for analytics and troubleshooting.
Usage Data: How you interact with the app, such as features used, time spent, and crash reports, to improve performance.
Third-Party Data: If you log in via a third-party service (e.g., Supabase Auth), we may receive your user ID or email from that service.

Purpose of Data Collection
We use your data for the following purposes:

To provide core app functionality, such as managing tasks and student lists.
To authenticate your identity and secure your account.
To improve the app’s performance, fix bugs, and analyze usage trends.
To comply with legal obligations, such as data protection laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, FERPA).

We do not use your data for advertising purposes.
Data Sharing
We may share your data in the following cases:

With Service Providers: We use Supabase for data storage and authentication. Your data may be shared with them as needed to provide the app’s services.
For Legal Reasons: If required by law, we may disclose your data to comply with legal processes (e.g., subpoenas) or protect our rights.
With Your Consent: If you share task or student data with others (e.g., teachers or students), that data may be visible to them.

We do not sell your data to third parties.
Data Protection
We take reasonable measures to protect your data, including:

Encrypting data in transit using SSL/TLS.
Storing data securely with Supabase, which follows industry-standard security practices.
Limiting access to your data to authorized personnel only.

However, no system is 100% secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute protection.
Data Retention

We retain your personal data as long as your account is active or as needed to provide services.
Task and student data are kept until deleted or your account is terminated.
We may retain anonymized data for analytics purposes indefinitely.

Your Data Rights
As a user, you have the following rights:

Access: Request a copy of your data.
Correction: Update or correct your personal information.
Deletion: Request deletion of your data (subject to legal obligations).
Opt-Out: Withdraw consent for certain data uses (e.g., analytics).
To exercise these rights, email us at support@tasktracker.com.

Cookies and Tracking
We may use cookies or similar technologies for analytics and session management. You can manage cookie preferences in your device settings, but disabling them may affect app functionality.
International Data Transfers
Your data may be stored on Supabase servers located outside your country. We ensure these transfers comply with data protection laws by using providers with adequate safeguards.
Children’s Privacy
The Task Admin app is not intended for use by children under 13. We comply with FERPA and other laws to protect student data handled by admins.
Changes to This Policy
We may update this policy from time to time. Changes take effect 10 days after we post the revised policy here. We encourage you to review it periodically.

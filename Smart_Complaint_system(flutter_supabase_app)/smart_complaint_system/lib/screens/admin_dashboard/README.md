# Admin Dashboard - Navigation-Based System

## Overview

The admin dashboard has been redesigned to use a navigation-based system where each menu item opens in a new screen instead of switching widgets within the same screen. This provides a more attractive and professional user experience.

## Architecture

### Main Dashboard (`admin_dashboard.dart`)
- **Purpose**: Shows the main dashboard overview with statistics and analytics
- **Navigation**: Contains the sidebar/drawer navigation menu
- **Content**: Only displays the `DashboardOverview` widget

### Individual Screens
Each management section now has its own dedicated screen:

1. **HOD Management** (`screens/hod_management_screen.dart`)
   - Manages Head of Department
   - Full-screen interface with dedicated header

2. **Batch Advisor Management** (`screens/batch_advisor_screen.dart`)
   - Manages batch advisors and their assignments
   - Full-screen interface with dedicated header

3. **Student Management** (`screens/student_management_screen.dart`)
   - Manages students and batch assignments
   - Full-screen interface with dedicated header

4. **Complaint Management** (`screens/complaint_management_screen.dart`)
   - Views and manages all complaints
   - Full-screen interface with dedicated header

5. **Batch View** (`screens/batch_view_screen.dart`)
   - Views all batches and their details
   - Full-screen interface with dedicated header

## Navigation System

### Navigation Menu (`widgets/navigation_menu.dart`)
- **Enhanced UI**: Improved visual design with animations and better styling
- **Navigation Logic**: Uses `Navigator.push()` to open new screens
- **Responsive**: Works on both mobile (drawer) and desktop (sidebar)

### Navigation Flow
1. **Dashboard**: Stays on current screen (index 0)
2. **HOD Management**: Opens `HodManagementScreen` (index 1)
3. **Batch Advisors**: Opens `BatchAdvisorScreen` (index 2)
4. **Students**: Opens `StudentManagementScreen` (index 3)
5. **Complaints**: Opens `ComplaintManagementScreen` (index 4)
6. **View Batches**: Opens `BatchViewScreen` (index 5)
7. **Logout**: Handles logout process (index 6)

## Benefits

### User Experience
- **Better Organization**: Each section has its own dedicated space
- **Cleaner Interface**: No widget switching clutter
- **Professional Look**: Full-screen interfaces look more polished
- **Better Navigation**: Clear back button and screen titles

### Technical Benefits
- **Separation of Concerns**: Each screen manages its own state
- **Better Performance**: No need to maintain all widgets in memory
- **Easier Maintenance**: Each screen can be developed independently
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new screens without affecting existing ones

## Usage

1. **Access Dashboard**: Login as admin to see the main dashboard
2. **Navigate**: Use the sidebar/drawer menu to access different sections
3. **Return**: Use the back button or navigation to return to dashboard
4. **Refresh**: Each screen has its own refresh button in the app bar

## Future Enhancements

- Implement screen transitions/animations
- Add search functionality across screens

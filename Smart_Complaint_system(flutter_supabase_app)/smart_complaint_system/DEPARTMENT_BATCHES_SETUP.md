# Department & Batches Management Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up the Department & Batches management feature and fix the current issues.

## Issues Fixed

1. **UI Overflow Errors**: Fixed Row widget overflow by adding `Expanded` widgets and `TextOverflow.ellipsis`
2. **Database Schema Error**: Added missing `description` column to departments table

## Database Setup

### Step 1: Add description column to departments table

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Migration to add description column to departments table
ALTER TABLE departments 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS description TEXT;

-- Add a comment to document the column
COMMENT ON COLUMN departments.description IS 'Description of the department';
```

### Step 2: Verify departments table structure

Your departments table should now have this structure:

```sql
CREATE TABLE departments (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT uuid_generate_v4(),
  name TEXT NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  description TEXT,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

## Troubleshooting

### If you still see overflow errors:
1. Make sure you've restarted the Flutter app
2. Check that all UI changes have been applied
3. The overflow errors should now be resolved

### If you see database errors:
1. Run the migration SQL above
2. Check that the departments table has the description column
3. Restart the Flutter app

### If department updates fail:
1. The code now has fallback handling for missing description column
2. Check the console for specific error messages
3. Ensure you have proper database permissions
